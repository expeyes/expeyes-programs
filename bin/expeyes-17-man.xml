A manual page <package>.<section> will be generated. You may view the
manual page with: nroff -man <package>.<section> | less'. A typical entry
in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

DB2MAN = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/docbook-xsl/manpages/docbook.xsl
XP     = xsltproc -''-nonet -''-param man.charmap.use.subset "0"

manpage.1: manpage.xml
        $(XP) $(DB2MAN) $<

The xsltproc binary is found in the xsltproc package. The XSL files are in
docbook-xsl. A description of the parameters you can use can be found in the
docbook-xsl-doc-* packages. Please remember that if you create the nroff
version in one of the debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need
to include xsltproc and docbook-xsl in your Build-Depends control field.
Alternatively use the xmlto command/package. That will also automatically
pull in xsltproc and docbook-xsl.

Notes for using docbook2x: docbook2x-man does not automatically create the
AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections. In this case, please add them manually as
<refsect1> ... </refsect1>.

To disable the automatic creation of the AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections
read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/doc/manpages/authors.html. This file can be
found in the docbook-xsl-doc-html package.

Validation can be done using: `xmllint -''-noout -''-valid manpage.xml`

      Expeyes-17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
      Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware &amp; software framework for
      developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
      science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
      measurements and analysing the data in different ways. Analog
      voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time intervals with
      one microsecond. This project is based on Free and Open Source
      software, mostly written in Python programming language. The hardware
      design is also open.
