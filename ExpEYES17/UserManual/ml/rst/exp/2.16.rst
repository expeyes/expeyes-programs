Digtizing sound
===============

**Objective**

Digitize sound signals from a microphone, and measure its frequency. Use
the Piezo buzzer or any other source of sound like a tuning fork.

**Procedure**

-  Enable A1 and MIC , with analysis
-  Position the buzzer facing the microphone
-  Set WG to 1000Hz, change it and watch the MIC output
-  Use a whistle instead of the buzzer and find out the frequency of MIC
   output.

**Discussion**

The driving signal and the microphone output is shown in figure

Sound waves create pressure variations in the medium through which it
travel. The microphone generates a voltage proportional to the pressure.
The voltage variations are in tune with the pressure variations. You can
consider the microphone as a pressure sensor, but working only for time
varying pressures.
