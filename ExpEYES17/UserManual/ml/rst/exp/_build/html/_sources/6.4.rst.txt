-  Keep a flat surface, like a cardboard sheet, around 10 cm from the
   echo module
-  Press START
-  Change the distance with time

**Discussion**

The distance is calculated from the time taken by a burst of sound to
echo from the surface kept in front of the module. The distance can be
measred as function of time, enabling to calculate velocity,
acceleration etc.
