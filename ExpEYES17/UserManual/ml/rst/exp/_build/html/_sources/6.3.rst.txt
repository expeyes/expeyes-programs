**Procedure**

Make a pendulum using two button magnets and a piece of paper. Suspend
it and place the 3000T coil near that, as shown in figure.

-  Connect the coil between SQ1 and ground
-  Calculate the resonant frequency from the length of the pendulum
-  Scan the frequency around the expected resonance frequency

**Discussion**

When SQ1 reaches the resonant frequency of the pendulum, the amplitude
goes up due to resonance. A 4 cm (from the center of the magnet to the
axis of oscillation) long pendulum resonated at around :math:`2,5~Hz`, almost
tallying with its calculated natural frequency. The resonant frequency
of the pendulum is given by :math:`f = 1/(2\pi\sqrt{g/l})`, where :math:`l` is the
distance from the center of the magnet to the point of suspension and :math:`g`
is the acceleration due to gravity.

Repeat the experiment by changing the length of the pendulum.
