**Procedure**

-  Set WG amplitude to 80 mV and frequency to 1000 Hz
-  Enable A1 and A2 and their analysis option
-  Select 1V range for both A1 and A2
-  Make connections and observe the output
-  Change gain by changing the resistor values.

**Discussion**

The amplitude gain and and the phase difference can be observed from the
results.
