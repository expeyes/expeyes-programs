Generating sound
================

**Objective**

Generate sound from electrical signals, using a Piezo-electric buzzer.
Digitize sound and measure its frequency. Use the Piezo buzzer or any
other source of sound like a tuning fork.

**Procedure**

-  Enable A1, and its analysis
-  Set WG to 1000Hz, change it and listen to the sound.

**Discussion**

When you change the frequency of the voltage that excites the Piezo,
both the frequency and the intesity of the sound changes. The intensity
is maximum near 3500 Hz, due to resonance. The resonant frequency of the
Piezo buzzer is decided by its size and mechanical properties.
