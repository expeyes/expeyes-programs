expeyes (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed the creation of $(DESTDIR) from Makefile. Either we use
    Debian/ubuntu, and this line is useless, or we do not use them,
    and this line is useless too, since $(DESTDIR) is a void string.
  * made libej-dev arch:any since it contains the architecture-specific
    file libej.a. Thank you Luca Flavigna for the explanation.
  * upgraded to the new upstream version. This removes one useless line
    from Makefile, and adds a new feature for users: easy measurement of
    resistances.
