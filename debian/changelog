expeyes (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed the creation of $(DESTDIR) from Makefile. Either we use
    Debian/ubuntu, and this line is useless, or we do not use them,

    file libej.a. Thank you Luca Flavigna for the explanation.

    from Makefile, and adds a new feature for users: easy measurement of
    resistances.
