                <font>When the simulator starts up you will see an animated schematic of a simple LRC circuit. The green colour indicates positive voltage. The grey colour indicates ground. A red colour indicates negative voltage. The moving yellow dots indicate current.</font><br><br>
                <font>To turn a switch on or off, just click on it. If you move the mouse over any component of the circuit, you will
                        see a short description of that component and its current state in the lower right corner of the window.
                        To modify a component, move the mouse over it, click the right mouse button (or control-click if you have
                        a Mac) and select &quot;Edit&quot;. You can also access the edit function by double-clicking on a component.</font><br><br>
                <font>There are three graphs at the bottom of the window; these act like oscilloscopes, each one showing the voltage
                        and current across a particular component. Voltage is shown in green, and current is shown in yellow. The
                        current may not be visible if the voltage graph is on top of it. The peak value of the voltage in the scope
                        window is also shown. Move the mouse over one of the scope views, and the component it is graphing will be
                        highlighted. To modify or remove a scope, click the right mouse button over it and choose &quot;remove&quot;
                        from the menu. There are also many other scope options in this context menu. To view a component in the scope,
                        click the right mouse button over the component and select &quot;View in Scope&quot;.</font><br><br>
                <font>The &quot;Circuits&quot; menu contains a lot of sample circuits for you to try.</font><br><br>
                <font>Some circuits, eg Basics-&gt;Potentiometer, contain potentiometers or variable voltage sources. These can be
                        adjusted using sliders that are added to the right hand tool bar, or by positioning the mouse pointer over
                        the component and using the scroll wheel.</font>

                    <div align="justify">
                    <font>You can get a blank circuit by choosing &quot;Blank Circuit&quot; from the &quot;Circuits&quot; menu. You
                            will need to add at least one voltage source to start the simulator.</font><br><br>
                    <font>To add components or a wire choose one of the &quot;Add....&quot; options from the &quot;Draw&quot; menu.
                            Note that common components have keyboard short-cuts to select their add mode. When in add mode the cursor
                            changes to a &quot;+&quot;. Click and drag the mouse to add a component.</font><br><br>
                    <font>Components may be moved and resized in the selection mode. When in selection mode the cursor changes to an
                            arrow. Choose &quot;Select/Drag Sel&quot; from the &quot;Draw&quot; menu or press &quot;space&quot;,
                            or press &quot;escape&quot; to go in to selection mode. Hovering over a component will highlight it and
                            show information about that component in the info area. Clicking and dragging on a component will move
                            the component. If you click and drag on the square handles or hold down the ctrl key this will resize
                            the component and move the terminals.</font><br><br>
                    <font>Wires only connect at their ends and not in the middle therefore you have to draw each segment of a wire
                            separately. If the simulator spots unconnected points it thinks you intended to connect it will highlight
                            these with a red circle.</font><br><br>
                    <font>Many components have adjustments that can be made using the edit function explained above. For resistors,
                            capacitors and inductors you can conveniently set the value from the E12 range by rolling the mouse wheel
                            when hovering over the component</font><br><br>
                    <font>The File menu allows you to import or export circuit description files. See notes below on browser compatibility.</font><br><br>
                    <font>The Reset button resets the circuit to a reasonable state. If the simulation is paused then hitting the Reset
                            button twice will restart it. The Run/Stop button allows you to pause the simulation. The Simulation
                            Speed slider allows you to adjust the speed of the simulation. If the simulation isn&#39;t time-dependent
                            (that is, if there are no capacitors, inductors, or time-dependent voltage sources), then this won&#39;t
                            have any effect. The Current Speed slider lets you adjust the speed of the dots, in case the currents
                            are so weak (or strong) that the dots are moving too slowly (or too quickly).</font>

                    <font>This simulator simulates the circuit using a series of short time steps. In each step the changes to the
                            voltages and currents in the circuit are calculated based on the component models and the current circuit
                            state. For this process to work the time steps used need to be significantly shorter than the duration
                            of any event of interest in the circuit. Or, if you prefer, the time steps need to be significantly shorter
                            than the period of the highest frequency signal of interest.</font><br><br>
                    <font>By default the simulator uses a 5&micro;s step size. This is OK for audio frequency signals but not for radio
                            frequency signals or fast digital signals. The step size can be changed from the &quot;Other Options...&quot;
                            dialog on the options menu. For comparison, the transmission line example in the application uses a 5ps
                            step size.</font><br><br>
                    <font>The step size shouldn&#39;t be confused with the &quot;Simulation Speed&quot; controlled by the slider in
                            the right hand panel. The step size controls how long (in simulated time) each step is. The &quot;Simulation
                            Speed&quot; slider controls how often (in real time) the computer calculates a step.</font>

                    <font>Physics simulations are not real life, and don&#39;t assume that simulation and reality are identical! This
                            simulation idealizes many components. Wires and component leads have no resistance. Voltage sources are
                            ideal - they will try and supply infinite current if you let them. Capacitors and inductors are 100%
                            efficient. Logic gate inputs draw zero current - not too bad as an approximation for CMOS logic, but
                            not typical of 1980s TTL for example. By all means use this simulator to help visualize circuits, but
                            always test in reality.</font><br><br>
                    <font>Sorry to break it to you folks, but the simulator numerically approximates models of components that are
                            also approximate. Even without allowing for any bugs it is just a rough guide to reality. This simulator
                            may be helpful for visualization, but used the wrong way any simulator can give a false sense of security.
                            Some people don&#39;t really grasp this important concept - I&#39;ve even had one user accuse the simulator
                            of &quot;lying&quot; because he (or she) didn&#39;t take account of the component idealizations and didn&#39;t
                            understand the actual performance of the components they chose to use. It&#39;s a key leaning for all
                            electronic engineers that they must always be fully aware of real-world component (and system) characteristics
                            and how these differ from any particular simulator they use. If you want more precise models of real-world
                            components then the SPICE-based simulators are much more appropriate tools than this one, but even then,
                            you should be aware of deviations from reality. As the great analogue circuit designer Bob Pease said
                            &quot;When a computer tries to simulate an analog circuit, sometimes it does a good job; but when it
                            doesn&#39;t, things get very sticky&quot;.</font><br><br>
                    <font>One consequence of the use of ideal components is that the simulator doesn&#39;t converge on a result for
                            circuits that have no defined behaviour - for example an ideal voltage source short-circuited by an ideal
                            wire. Another situation that can&#39;t be simulated under these assumptions is the current distribution
                            between the conductors if two perfect conductors are connected in parallel. When using the simulator
                            you must account for places where real electronics differs from the ideal.</font>

                    </legend>
                    <div align="justify">
                    <font>Here are some errors you might encounter:</font>
                    <ul>
                        <font>
                        <li>Voltage source loop with no resistance! - this means one of the voltage sources in your circuit is shorted.
                                Make sure there is some resistance across every voltage source.</li><br>
                        <li>Capacitor loop with no resistance! - it&#39;s not allowed to have any current loops containing capacitors
                                but no resistance. For example, capacitors connected in parallel are not allowed; you must put a
                                resistor in series with them. Shorted capacitors are allowed.</li><br>
                        <li>Singular matrix! - this means that your circuit is inconsistent (two different voltage sources connected
                                to each other), or that the voltage at some point is undefined. It might mean that some component&#39;s
                                terminals are unconnected; for example, if you create an op-amp but haven&#39;t connected anything
                                to it yet, you will get this error.</li><br>
                        <li>Convergence failed! - this means the simulator can&#39;t figure out what the state of the circuit should
                                be. Just click Reset and hopefully that should fix it. Your circuit might be too complicated, but
                                this happens sometimes even with the examples.</li><br>
                        <li>Transmission line delay too large! - the transmission line delay is too large compared to the timestep
                                of the simulator, so too much memory would be required. Make the delay smaller.</li><br>
                        <li>Need to ground transmission line! - the bottom two wires of a transmission line must always be grounded
                                in this simulator.</li>
                        </font>
