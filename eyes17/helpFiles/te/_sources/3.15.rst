PNP Transistor Output characteristics (CE)
===========================================

The basic working principle of a transistor is controlling a bigger current in circuit using a small current in another circuit. Being a three terminal device, one terminal has to be common for the two crcuits. The common emitter configuration
is very common in most of the applications. We can explore the working of the transistor by studying the relationships between various voltages at different terminals and currents through them. 


Objective
---------

Using a PNP transistor, plot the Collector voltage against the collector current
in a common emitter configuration. Repeat it for different base currennts. Collector current
is calculated from the voltage across the a 1K resistor, in the collector circuit.

-  Fix the transistor on a bread board and make the connections.
-  Set base voltage to the 1 volt and press the START button.
-  Repeat for different base currents, increment PV2 by 0.3 volt steps.

The resulting graphs are shown below. This experiments also can be done manually from
the oscilloscope GUI, by noting down the readings.

Discussion
----------

The characteristic curves for different base currents are shown in
figure. The collector current is obtained from the voltage difference
across the :math:`1~k\Omega` resistor.

The base current is set by setting the voltage at one end of the :math:`100~k\Omega`
resistor, the other end is connected to the transistor base. The value
of base current is calculated by,
:math:`I_b = (V_{PV2}   V_{A2})/(100 \times 10^3) \times 10^6~\mu A`.
If A2 is not connected, the code assumes 0.6 volts at the base to
calculate the base current.
