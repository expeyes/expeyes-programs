Getting Familiar with ExpEYES17
===============================
TODO

Before proceeding with the experiments, let us do some simple exercises
to become familiar with expEYES-17. Connect the device a USB port and
start the ExpEYES-17 program from the menu ’Applications->Education’.
Enable the ’Popup Help’ option and select the first few items from the
school menu.

The following chapters are organized according to the pulldown menus of
the eyes17 program, each chapter containing the experiments under the
corresponding menu; like School level, Eelectronics, Eelectrical etc. To
perform the expeiment, select it from the menu. Online help is available
for every experiment, making this manual almost redundant.

The screen shots given in this document are not from the GUI program,
because the black background images are difficult to print. The plots
are generated by separate code.
