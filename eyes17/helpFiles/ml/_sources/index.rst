School Level Experiments
************************

This chapter will discuss the experiments and demonstrations without
much data analysis, experiments given in the menu SchoolExpts. Simple
tasks like measuring voltage, resistance, capacitance etc. will be done
followed by resistances changing with temperature or light. The concept
of Alternating Current is introduced by plotting the voltage as a
function of time. Generating and digitizing sound will be covered. When
an experiment is selected, the corresponding help window will popup, if
enabled.

Electronics
***********

This chapter explains several electronics experiments. Most of them are
done using the oscilloscope GUI. Some of them like Diode and Transistor
characteristics have a dedicated GUI.

Electricity and Magnetism
*************************

This section mainly contains experiments on the steady state and
transient response of LCR circuit elements. the experimental results
with the theory. It also gives an experiment of electromagnetic
induction.

Sound
*****

Pressure variations, about an equilibrium pressure, transmitted through
a medium is called sound. They are longitudinal waves. Moving a sheet of
paper back and forth in air can generate these kind of pressure waves,
like the paper cone of a loudspeaker. When the frequency is within 20 to
20000Hz range, we can hear the sound. In this chapter, we will generate
sound from electrical signals, detect them using the built-in microphone
(a pressure sensor) and study the properties like amplitude and
frequency. Velocity of sound is measured by observing the phase shift of
digitized sound with distance.

Mechanics
*********

Resonance phenomena is studied using a driven pendulum. Value of
acceleration due to gravity is measured using a pendulum.

Coding expEYES-17 in Python
***************************

The GUI programs described in the previous sections are meant for a
fixed set of experiments. To develop new experiments, one should know
how to access the features of expEYES from software. Important function
calls used for communicating with the device is given below.
