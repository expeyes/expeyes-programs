Multiplexed Data Logger
=======================

The CD74HC4067 is an analog multiplexer. It connects one of its 16 inputs (C0 - C15) to the SIG
output pin based on the logic level on the input pins S0,S1,S2,S3. These 4 digital input pins constitute
a 4 bit number that decides the analog input to be mapped to SIG.

Set CS1,CS2,CS3,CS4 pins on the SEELab3 device are connected to the configuration inputs of the CD74HC4067
multiplexer, and the set_multiplexer call of the eyes17 library can be used to select the input.

The SIG output signal of the multiplexer can now be connected to a voltmeter input in order to measure any of the C0-C15 inputs. The other
end of the signal source must be connected to GND(Ground).
The software allows selecting up to 16 of the available inputs for data logging for a specified interval.

Voltmeter options
+ A1, A2, A3 are built in voltmeters of the SEELab3/ExpEYES17 . The SIG output can be connected to any of these.
+ The ADS1115 is a 16 bit ADC with 4 unipolar as well as 2 differential input options.
+ For unipolar inputs, UNI_0, UNI_1, UNI_2, or UNI_3 pin can be connected to SIG with the other end of each sample connected to GND.
+ For Differential inputs, DIFF_01, and DIFF_23 are available. connect SIG to ADS1, and ADS0 to the other end of the sample to get differential readings.
