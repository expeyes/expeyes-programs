I2C Logger
==========

A wide variety of sensors for physical parameters such as pressure, temperature,
humidity, light intensity, magnetic fields etc use the I2C communication interface
to exchange data.

Make the following connections between the sensor and ExpEYES/SEELab device
5V -> Vcc of the sensor
GND -> GND
SCL -> SCL
SDA -> SDA

These pins are usually found in this order in most sensors, so 
the top right side of the SEELab3/ExpEYES devices also have these in this
order in order to help plug sensors easily.

Procedure
---------


- Click on the scan button to allow the device to search for any connected sensors and guess their name
- Scan may not always be correct since multiple sensors can share the same address sometimes.
- If the address or name of the sensor does not match, select your sensor name from the top left menu, set the correct address, and add manually
- click on 'start measurements' for the sensor you want to view
- In order to change from the default analog gauge view, click on the data logger button on the top left
- The data logger records and plots readings with time, and you can pause at any point to analyze the data
- Select the region to be analyzed, and click on sine fit if the data is periodic
- You can also save the data
