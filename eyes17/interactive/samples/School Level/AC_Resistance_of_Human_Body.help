## Conducting human

The human body is a weak conductor. 

We can demonstrate this by touching a wire connected to WG( which is a 3 Volt sine wave source), and touching another wire connected to the A2(Voltage input) with the other hand. 

We can see a signal appearing on A2 when we connect WG with A2 via our body. To see the original signal, we connect WG to A1 directly via a wire.
