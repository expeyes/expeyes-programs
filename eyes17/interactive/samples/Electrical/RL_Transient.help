# RL Transient response

This is a work in progress. 

Tap on OD1 to set it ON/OFF , and observe that A1 behaves accordingly.

Now tap on the `SET OD1 LOW` or `SET OD1 HIGH` capture which records the transient behaviour and plots it.


e.g. , if OD1 was OFF, then use the `SET OD1 HIGH` to view the charging curve of the RL

Use the visual programming interface instead of the interactive schematic

### Features to implement

+ Adjustable timebase
+ Curve fit to exponential equation
