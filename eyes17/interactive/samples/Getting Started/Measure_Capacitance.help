## Measure capacitance

connect a capacitor between IN1 and GND, and click on the CAP button to measure its capacitance value

## Activities

Make parallel plate capacitors using small metal sheets separated by a sheet of paper, and measure them.


* To make a parallel plate capacitor, you will need the following materials:

* Two conductive plates (such as metal or foil)
* Insulating material (such as plastic or paper)
* Wires or conductive leads
* Dielectric material (optional, can be air or a specific insulating material)

## Here's a step-by-step guide

* Prepare the Plates: Take two conductive plates/foil/sheet of suitable size and shape. These plates should be made of a conductive material like metal or aluminium foil.

* Insulating Material: Cut a piece of insulating material, such as plastic or paper, to serve as a spacer between the plates.

* Plate Alignment: Position the insulating material between the two conductive plates, ensuring that it is centered and aligned properly. This insulating material will prevent direct electrical contact between the plates while allowing the electric field to form between them.

* Connection Leads: Attach wires to connect one conductive plate connect to IN1, and the other to GND.

What happens to the measured capacitance if you make the area of your capacitor half?
