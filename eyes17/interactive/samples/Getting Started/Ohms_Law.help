## What is Ohm's Law

Ohm's law is a fundamental principle in electricity that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit.
It states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional 
to the resistance of the conductor. 

Mathematically, Ohm's law is expressed as:

`V = I * R`



Where:

    V represents the voltage measured in volts (V),
    I represents the current measured in amperes (A),
    R represents the resistance measured in ohms (Î©).

According to Ohm's law, if the resistance in a circuit remains constant, the current flowing through the circuit is directly proportional 
to the applied voltage. Similarly, if the voltage remains constant, the current is inversely proportional to the resistance.

So if you know the current flowing through a resistor(R), and you know the potential difference across it, you can calculate its resistance as R=V/I . 

## Verifying Ohm's Law

Connect a known value resistor(1K) between PV1(Voltage Source) and A1(Voltmeter), and an unknown value resistor from A1 to Ground.

* Using Ohm's law, we calculate the current flowing through R1 as (PV1 - A1)/1K . 

* Since the same current must now flow through R2 also in order to reach GND , we can calculate R2 as A1/I where I was earlier calculated.

## Bonus assignment

Replace R2 with a diode/LED/Zener, and observe the behaviour.
This program can also be used to observe the IV characteristics of different devices.
