## LDR Experiment



A Light Dependent Resistor's resistance changes with the intensity of the light falling
on it.

Connect the LDR between SEN and Ground, and observe the resistance .

## Measuring frequency using an LDR

shine a fluctuating light source on the LDR, and observe the signal fluctuations on the oscilloscope shown below the schematic. You can use this to calculate the frequency of the fluctuations.
