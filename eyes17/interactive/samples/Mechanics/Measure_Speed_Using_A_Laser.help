## Timing measurements using a laser and a photo transistor

+ Point the laser at the phototransistor via a couple of mirrors as shown in the diagram
+ Click the timing button
+ Move and object through the laser path such that it interrupts the beam twice.
+ When the first interruption occurs, the timer is started
+ The timer stops when the second interruption occurs.

When the TIMING button is clicked, the
