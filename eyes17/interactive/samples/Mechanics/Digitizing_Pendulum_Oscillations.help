## Simple Pendulum

A pendulum is attached to the shaft of a DC Motor using a thin stiff rod. When the pendulum oscillates, the coil inside the motor rotates with it, and a voltage is generated by the motor. This voltage is proportional to the speed of the pendulum, and changes polarity when the pendulum moves in the opposite direction.

## Discussion

The time period of the pendulum can be extracted by fitting the extracted data against a standard damped sine wave equation
